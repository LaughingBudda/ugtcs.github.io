          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>Berkeley is one of the cradles of modern theoretical computer science. Over the last thirty years, our students and professors have contributed to fundamental progress in complexity theory, optimization, algorithmic game theory, cryptography, quantum computing and more. Within these areas, we see a thriving interest among undergraduates that is stranger than it has been before, but at the same time, many of our classmates also find these areas largely unapproachable.</p>
          <p>From students who are still taking CS70 to those who have already finished graduate seminar courses in theory, our goal is to create a broader community for students of all interests and backgrounds to learn and get involved in theoretical computer science. Through social events, study groups, talks, seminars, and annual decals, we hope to explore the mathematical foundations of CS as well as its intrinsic connections other studies: economics through computational game theory and mechanism design, physics through random structures and quantum computing, biology, and mathematics.</p>
          <p>Our events strive to be not only educative and enlightening, but also approachable and fun. Please consider joining us as we learn more about theoretical computer science. We have a slack channel and email list dedicated to group activities. If you are interested in joining the group then fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/61N2WDgfWofbYfvn1">this form</a> with your email and consider stopping by one of our general or study group meetings!</p>
